# FFT-SKG-AGI

This project is an experimental framework that generates and visualizes glyphs and uses them in a simple SKG (Self-Knowledge Graph) engine. The code allows creation of glyph representations of user-provided tokens and processes them through agency gates for decision making.

## Setup

1. It is recommended to use Python 3.8 or newer.
2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Execute the interactive engine from the repository root:

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will prompt for a token and display agency gate decisions. Type `exit` to quit.
